This app implemented the MusicBrainz API to search the places and draw output as a pin on the Google map. This codebase used an architecture component to show an approach to using some of the best practices in Android Development.   
Including:    
 * MVVM  
 * Architecture Components  
 * Kotlin  
 * Kotlin Coroutines  
 * Kotlin Extension Functions  
 * ViewModel  
 * LiveData  
 * Hilt (for dependency injection)  
 * Retrofit 2.0  
 * Okhttp3  
 * Test Cases  
   
  
All the dependencies are declared in the build.gradle file. No need to take some extra measure.   
Google Map API key is not included on the Version Control System due to some security reasons.  
For this you can use your own key in the `local.properties` file.  
 
> MAPS_API_KEY= YOUR_API_KEY

  
 Replace **YOUR_API_KEY** with your API key.
